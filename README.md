## Baby kick tracker

An example of this app running can be seen at http://kickcounter.herokuapp.com

A simple Rails application that allows a user to track the rate of a baby's kicks over time.

The process is:

* Create an account
* Start a "kick session"
* Hit the "kick" button every time you feel a kick
* After 10 kicks, the session is saved (with the start time and end time)

The idea is that by using the app at the same time each day you build up a picture of a baby's activity over time.

Important note: I am not a baby-doctor of any kind. This is not a medical device. It's a cute toy that might take the edge off an otherwise really boring activity.
